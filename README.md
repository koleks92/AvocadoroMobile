### Session View & Timer

To open a session group, click its name on the dashboard. This view contains the following:

**Navigation & Editing:**

- **Top-left:** Back button to return to the dashboard.

- **Top-right:** Edit button (see the Editing an Existing Session Group section).

**Timer Display**:

- **Center**: Displays the session name, current mode (Focus or Break), and the time remaining.
- **Motivational Quotes**: A section below the timer providing inspiration during your session.
- **Controls**:

    ▶ **Play**: Start the focus or break timer.

    ⏸ **Pause**: Temporarily pause the active timer.

    ♻︎ **Reset**: Hold the reset button for 1 second to return the timer to its initial state.

**Total Time & Visualization:**

- **Arrow Down**: Click this to hide the timer and open the Total Focus Time view.

- **Visualization**: This view shows a visual representation of your progress. A Legend in the top-left corner explains what each symbol represents in terms of time.

- **Arrow Up**: Click this to return to the active timer view.

<br>

**⚠️ Important Rules**

- **Saving Progress**: If you reset the timer before reaching the break session, that focus time will not be added to the session group's total.

- **Navigation Lock**: You cannot go back to the dashboard or edit the session group while the timer is running or paused. You must reset the timer to its initial state first.

- S**ession Transitions**: When the Focus time ends, a sound alarm will play, and the status will automatically change to Break. The break timer will then start. An alarm also sounds when the break time concludes.

---

### Settings

To access the settings menu, click the **Settings icon** located in the **bottom-right corner** of the Dashboard.

Currently, the settings menu allows you to manage your profile and account data:

**Removing your Account:**

-   1. Click the **Remove Account** button.
-   2. To confirm the deletion, click the **Trash Can icon**.
       <br>

**⚠️ Important**

- **This action cannot be reversed.** Removing your account will permanently delete all of your account information, session groups, and focus history from the database.
